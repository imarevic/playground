# Playground

Playground of small projects related to coding, probability theory and stats.
The code is capsuled for each small project but there is a global virtual env for the entire
repo. The environment can be setup as follows:

1. Create virtual environment: `python -m venv env`
2. Activate environment: `source env/bin/activate`
3. Install required packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

To deactivate the environment execute `deactivate`

The capsuled source code is run in jupyter notebooks. To start the jupyter server execute `jupyter notebook` either from root of the repo or within each sub-directory.

    "There are many urn sampling methods discussed in probability theory (e.g. sampling with replacement, sampling without replacement). The Polya urn sampling scheme is a special case in which we have an urn that initially contains *a* red and *b* blue balls, with *a* and *b* being positive integers.\n",
    "At each trial one ball is draw from the urn and then returned with *c* additional balls of the same color. Usually, the *c* parameter is a nonnegative integer, but the model also makes sense if it is negative:\n",
    "\n",
    "- if $c=1$ then this corresponds to classic Polya sampling\n",
    "- if $c=0$ then this corresponds to sampling with replacement (binomial distribution)\n",
    "- if $c=-1$ then this corresponds to sampling without replacement (hypergeometric distribution)\n",
